## Designing and Delivering technical solutions that customers need
My passion is to deliver innovative and technical solutions that customers need. The design of the solution is aligned with business stakeholders and addresses a hypothesis of the customer value we want to deliver. The implementation of the solution is built agile, in sprints, by a DevOps team that is autonomous and accountable.

With my experience in CX technology and customer-first thinking, I can bring the value customers expect from you.

## My Experience and Services
I started my career as a web developer and grew into an experienced Solution Architect. In the last 20 years, I have designed and delivered Ecommerce solutions, Marketplaces, Content-, Digital Marketing-, and Customer Data solutions. As a Solution Architect, I have designed the solution, created solution diagrams, integration specifications, and data models. When preparing for implementation I created a technology roadmap with a stepped approach: MVP, Improve, Excel.

I worked with many different software partners like Adobe, Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce, Algolia, CommerceTools, Contentstack, and more. The knowledge and experience I have gained, help me to understand the strengths and weaknesses of every solution. This is extremely valuable in software selection processes to find the best solution for the use-cases we need.

I am a true believer in Composable Architecture. This new architecture principle helps organizations to increase go-to-market and early adopt new client expectations with new services, like new channels to interact. Using the Strangler Pattern it is possible to transition from a monolithic platform to a Composable platform while keeping the shop running.
