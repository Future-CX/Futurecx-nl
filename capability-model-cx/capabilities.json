An Enterprise Search is connected to many data sources, like Product Data, Content, Knowledge Articles, Digital Assets, etc. Search can be personalized using customer data, like interests, browsing behavior, previous bought products or services or profile data. A search query can be executed by inputting text in a search field or, when connected to a conversational platform, via chatbot or voicebot.A strong benefit of a good search is to avoid customers calling Customer Service Agents with their questions and enable more self-service for the customers."
